# Security Policy

At Centlax, we take security seriously. We appreciate the efforts of security researchers and the community in helping us maintain the safety and integrity of our projects.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Preferred Method: GitHub Private Reporting

1. Navigate to the [Security tab](https://github.com/centlax/report/security/advisories/new) of the appropriate GitHub repository.
2. Click on "New private vulnerability report".
3. Fill out the form with as much detail as possible about the vulnerability.

For more information on this process, please refer to [GitHub's documentation on privately reporting a security vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

### Alternative Method: Email

If GitHub private reporting is not possible, please email us at **ui.security@centlax.com**.

## What to Include in Your Report

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact of the vulnerability
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations (if available)

## Our Commitment

- We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 5 business days.
- We will provide regular updates about our progress.
- We will notify you when the vulnerability is fixed.

## Scope

This security policy applies to all repositories and projects under the Centlax organization.

## Responsible Disclosure

We kindly ask that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a chance to address it.

## Keeping Dependencies Updated

While we strive to maintain secure code, vulnerabilities in dependencies can also pose risks. We recommend:

- Always use the latest versions of Svelte, SvelteKit, and other dependencies.
- Regularly update your lock files (`yarn.lock`, `package-lock.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`).
- Consider using automated tools for dependency updates and vulnerability scanning.

## Bug Bounty Program

Currently, we do not offer a bug bounty program. However, we deeply appreciate the efforts of security researchers and will acknowledge your contributions in our security advisories.

## Thank You

Your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings are sincerely appreciated and will be taken into account to improve our security.
